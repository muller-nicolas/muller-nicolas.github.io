I am a theoretical physicist specializing in fluid dynamics and turbulence in geophysical and astrophysical flows. My work integrates advanced numerical simulations and theoretical modeling to address complex problems in fluid dynamics.

My research interests include the study of quantum fluids and superfluid turbulence, an out-of-equilibrium regime driven by the complex interaction between quantum vortices. This is a fascinating system that displays differences and similarities with classical turbulence, and understanding it could help for the development of future theories for turbulent flows. 
I am also interested in the geodynamo problem, mechanism by which the Earth's magnetic field is generated. I am particularly interested in the process of magnetic reversals.

I currently hold a postdoctoral researcher position at the Laboratoire de Physique des Plasmas (LPP) at the École Polytechnique in Paris, where my research focuses on the theoretical and numerical study of wave turbulence in the solar wind.
